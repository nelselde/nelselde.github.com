    <img class="grpelem" id="u5746-97" alt="MB/BC Program Scavenger Hunt v.1.0 You are surrounded by a lot of resources to enhance your training and research projects at the University of Utah. One of the main objectives of the scavenger hunt v.1.0 is to find and take advantage of these resources so that you might keep using them during your Ph.D. training. Also, you can win prizes for you and your team. In addition, there will be at least one “spirit award” given to an individual most sincerely engaged in the scavenger hunt. Also, your class’ overall point total will be recorded for the Hall of Fame Leaderboard for years to come. Cooperate and collaborate! Here’s how it all works. Your group will split up tasks and in some cases everyone in the group will participate in them. You don’t have to do them all. The hunt runs from the start of class Thursday January 19th until the start of class on Thursday January 31st. You can contact us with questions and for advice along the way. In class on Tuesday January 31st each team will present your progress to our panel of TA and faculty judges who will award points for each event you tackle. Good luck. Scavenger hunt events: 1. Generate an Endnote bibliography from a research paper with at least 50 references and format it for submission to the journal eLife (note the paper you pick can’t be already published in eLife). (up to 10 points) 2. Use a 3D printer on campus to print a virus particle based on its crystallographic/EM structural coordinates and give a two-minute presentation on the biology of the virus you print at the judging session. (up to 50 pts) 3. Devise a local seminar series calendar for 2016/17 (should reach back to the fall) on a fairly broad topic of modern biology (e.g., Evolutionary Genetics). Use actual speakers from at least four different seminar series on campus (e.g. Departmental, University-wide, Interest Groups, Training Grants) and the actual schedules this academic season. You should have at least 10 speakers on your calendar. (up to 25 pts) 4. Produce an excel spreadsheet with everyone in your group’s ORCID (register for an ORCID if necessary). (up to 10 pts) 5. Present a photograph of your group (at least three members) with a research librarian. (up to 5 points) (+1 for all members of group in photo) (+1 signed by the librarian) 6. Present a photograph of your group (at least three members) with Erik Jorgensen or Sophie Caron or Ofer Rog (up to 4 points) (+1 for all members of group in photo) (+1 signed by professor) (only one photo per group in this category) 7. Present a photograph of your group (at least three members) with a state legislator/local politician. (up to 12 points) (+1 for all members of group in photo) (+1 signed by legislator/politician) 8. Pick a specific research topic and create a digital feed of papers (e.g., “web crawler”, RSS feed, PubMED saved search) that returns at least 10 new publications from the last two months. (up to 10 points) 9. Find Mike Redd in the Microscopy core and take a photo with him and your group (at least three members) (up to 6 points) (+1 all members of group)(+1 signed by Mike). And get up to +6 for producing a three-color fluorescence image from one of the microscopes. 10. Find James Marvin in the Flow Cytometry core and take a photo with him and your group (at least three members) (up to 6 points) (+1 all members of group)(+1 signed by James). And get up to +6 for producing a two-marker flow plot of a sample. 11. Record a 5 minute audio podcast highlighting the results of a primary research paper to explain why it is interesting/important to the science curious public. (up to 15 points) 12. Produce an excel spreadsheet with everyone in your group’s Twitter account names and curate a list of 10 tweets highlighting interesting science papers. (up to 10 points) 13. Draw a graphical abstract (see examples at Cell.com) of a paper in the Treasure Chest (up to 15 points) Use Illustrator (+5 points) 14. Photocopy, scan, grab a pdf, or take a snapshot (phone camera) of a published drawing of the charismatic ciliate species Lacrymaria olor from a journal issue published before 1980. (up to 5 points) 15. Attend a local seminar (ahem, Craig Mello; at least three group members) and write a single, short one-paragraph summary of the presentation (up to 10 points). And get up to +10 additional points for writing a second lay summary of the seminar directed towards the public. You can do up to six seminars as a group. Also, up to 10 bonus points if you present a photo (selfie or taken by a team member or colleague) of you asking the speaker a question. 16. Produce a Kaplan-Meier curve using artificial data, and format in illustrator. Include a legend describing your data and any relevant statistical tests (up to 15 points). 17. Find and print out instructions specifying how to format manuscript figures for submission to three different journals (Science, eLife, Cell, etc.) (up to 15 points). And get up to +10 additional points for generating an example figure in one of the formats. 18. Make Powerpoint or Keynote slides showing Figures from a Treasure Chest paper. Figures must be at high resolution and include titles (up to 10 points). 19. Insert a Figure made in Illustrator (can use previous ones you have made from “Abstract to Figures” Unit) into Powerpoint or Keynote presentation with high resolution (up to 5 points). And get up to +5 points for inserting Figure into Microsoft word (include legend). 20. Write a detailed protocol for preparing a whole cell protein lysate from S. cerevisiae cells (up to 10 points). And up to +5 points for including catalog numbers of reagents needed in the protocol. 21. Take a publically available genome sequence (BAM) file from a human and only from the sequence data predict the sex or blood type of that person. Explain how you made your prediction (up to 30 points) 22. Make a laboratory website for your group using Adobe Muse or another website generating software program. (up to 25 points). (up to +5 if it is available on the internet). 23. Record a 5 minute video highlighting an exciting scientific discovery, paper, or emerging field that is accessible to the science-curious public (up to 30 points). 24. Record a 5 minute video interview with a faculty member in a biological science related field from the University or another educational institution in Utah discussing their research program. (up to 30 points). 25. Share a truly stunning/inspiring science related video found on the internet (up to 10 points). 26. Share a resource, interview, biography, or link that could be added to the class website’s Treasure Trove (up to 10 points). 27. Propose an exciting new event for the Scavenger Hunt (up to 10 points). Execute your event (up to 10 points).
